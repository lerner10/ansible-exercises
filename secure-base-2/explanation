In this stage you need to do these things:

Connect the postgres container to volume to gain persistence

Create a pgadmin container with volume, configure email and password from vault env vars

MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING TWO DIFFERENT VAULT FILES

Enter the pgadmin and connect between the pgadmin to postgres, restart both containers and make sure there is persistence
